# AdventOfCode2019

My solutions to the 2019 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) daily december programming challenges.

Solution are in Ruby and C++, most are solved in Ruby first and then rewritten in C++ if I had spare time.

Solution stucture:
* day_lib - All functions used to solve the problem
* day_test - Unit tests for lib functions
* day - Runner script that calls lib functions to output solution results
